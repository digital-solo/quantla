                                investment decisions and trading:</span></div>

                        <div>Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments
                            involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals. Any
                            trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses. The
                            practice of "Day Trading" involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose
                            substantial sums of money. Before undertaking any trading program, you should consult a
                            qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable
                            for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks. Under no
                            circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a
                            result of any trading or investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any
                            information or material you receive through Quantla or our services.
                        </div>

                        <div class="mt-5" style="margin-bottom: 20px;font-weight: bold"><span>5. Disclaimer regarding
                                hypothetical performance results:</span></div>

                        <div>Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are
                            mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to
                            achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp
                            differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently
                            achieved by any particular trading program.

                            One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally
                            prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve
                            financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of
                            financial risk in actual trading. For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere
                            to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which
                            can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the
                            market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be
                            fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which
                            can adversely affect actual trading results.

                        <div>By ordering any subscription on Quantla you
                            confirm that you have read and accepted our Terms of Use and you authorize Quantla to

                            manually selected by you.

                            The service is billed in advance on a monthly, annual, or 2-year basis. There will be no

                            All billing is recurring, which means you will continue to get billed until you cancel your

                            subscription. An email request or support ticket asking for your subscription to be

                            visiting the billing section of your Profile Settings page.

                            If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid up period, your subscription

                            automatic monthly renewal of the Service, you can cancel the subscription to avoid billing
